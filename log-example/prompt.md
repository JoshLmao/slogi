i need to modify the code to support parsing log categories that dont always start with "Log". a log line can contain any of the following things but they are optional, even a log category is optional.
Date time, log category, log level and the log text.
each line of a log has the important bits of information in different formats. below is examples of the lines and what they contains

No category:

```
Log file open, 01/15/25 18:39:19
```

category

```
SourceControl: Revision control is disabled
LogPluginManager: Mounting Project plugin OnlineTracing
```

Date time, category, text

```
[2025.01.15-18.39.29:725][  0]LogMetaSound: MetaSound Engine Initialized
```

Date time, Category, level, text

```
[2025.01.15-18.39.40:956][  0]LogDirectoryWatcher: Display: CreateFile failed for 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Epic Games/Games/Fortnite/FortniteGame/Plugins/GameFeatures/Juno/JunoTheme_OsirisSurvivor_LonelyLodge/Content/Localization'. GetLastError code [3]
```

multiline

```
[2025.01.15-18.39.28:852][  0]LogConsoleResponse: User settings details:
- Resolution: 0x0@120.0Hz at 0.0% 3D Resolution
- Fullscreen mode: WindowedFullscreen, VSync: 0
- Motion blur: 0, RHIT: 0
```

if a line doesnt have a category to parse, then it should be asigned to the category "NoLogCategory". if a line doesnt have a log level, then it should be assigned "Log".

if its a multiline, the extra lines should only show when LogConsoleResponse is also selected and set to the same log level. If there is no log level, then it should show when Log is chosen.

first read the code and understand what it does to maintain the functionality and other edge cases ive already coded. then make your edits
